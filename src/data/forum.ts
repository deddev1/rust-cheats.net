    answer: 'The guide covers player boxes, names, health and distance, skeleton ESP, loot and resource markers, and the radar overlay. The exact options depend on the selected product tier.',
    detail: 'It recommends starting with a restrained layout and enabling only the information you can read comfortably during a fight at a monument or on a base wall.',

    detail: 'Test your layout on a low-population or private server before relying on it in a busy one. A simple configuration is easier to read than turning on every option immediately.',

    answer: 'Choose one weapon and one profile to test at a time. The guide walks through example profiles for the AK, LR-300, MP5 and bolt rifle, and explains how bone selection fits with recoil compensation.',
    detail: 'A private server lets you repeat the same spray at a wall and see which values need adjustment without risking your kit.',

    answer: 'The troubleshooting guide says the message can result from game-file problems or software conflicts and does not always mean an account ban. First verify Rust files through Steam.',
    detail: 'It also recommends fully exiting Steam, reinstalling EAC from the Rust folder, restarting the PC, and checking for conflicting overlays or drivers before trying more disruptive steps.',
